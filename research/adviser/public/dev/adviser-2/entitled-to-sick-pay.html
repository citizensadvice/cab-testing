          </div>
          <p>With many jobs, if you’re off sick for a few days, you still get paid. This is because you have contractual sick pay. Your contract should tell you what you’re entitled to. If you haven’t been given a contract or it’s not in there, ask your employer or check your staff handbook.</p>
          <div class="callout--adviser">
            <p>This page mostly covers statutory sick pay. <a href="/Views/Pages/Beta/BetaContentPageTemplate.aspx?id=58507">Get more detail on contractual sick pay</a>.</p>
          </div>
          <p>Not all employers offer contractual sick pay, but there’s also statutory sick pay (SSP). All employers have to give you this, by law, as long as you:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>have done at least one day’s work for your employer</li>
            <li>are sick for 4 full days or more in a row (including non-working days)</li>
            <li>earn on average more than £112 a week (before tax)</li>
          </ul>
          <p>You still get it if you’re an agency or casual worker, or if you work part-time or on a fixed-term or zero hours contract.</p>
          <p>SSP can give you £88.45 a week for up to 28 weeks.</p>
          <p>You’ll need to follow some rules to <a href="/Views/Pages/Beta/BetaContentPageTemplate.aspx?id=57592">get sick pay you’re entitled to</a>.</p>
          <section class="revealable revealable--adviser">
            <h3>Who is entitled to statutory sick pay</h3>
            <p>Most people who work can get SSP. Entitlement is based on social security law, rather than employment law.</p>
            <p>Your client is entitled to SSP if they work and on average earn more than £112 a week - enough for their employer to pay secondary class 1 national insurance contributions. This includes agency workers and office holders, such as police officers, who may not qualify for other employment rights.</p>
          </section>
          <section class="revealable revealable--adviser">
            <h3>When you can get statutory sick pay</h3>
            <p>Your client has to be in a ‘period of incapacity for work’ to get SSP. This means being sick for at least 4 days in a row - including non-working days such as weekends and public holidays.</p>
            <p>In a period of incapacity for work, your client will only get SSP for days when they'd be working if they weren't sick. These are called 'qualifying days'.</p>
            <p>There's no SSP for the first 3 qualifying days of a period of incapacity for work. These are called 'waiting days'.</p>
            <p>Your client must have the whole day off sick for it to count. If they go off sick partway through the day it only counts if they did no work before they left.</p>
          </section>
          <section class="revealable revealable--adviser">
            <h3>How much statutory sick pay is paid</h3>
            <p>For any full week your client has off work they will get the full weekly rate of £88.45, even if they work part-time.</p>
            <p>They will get a daily rate of SSP for the first and last weeks of their sickness if they’re not full weeks.</p>
            <p>You can use the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/calculate-statutory-sick-pay">statutory sick pay calculator</a> on GOV.UK to work out exactly what they’ll get, or <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/statutory-sick-pay-manually-calculate-your-employees-payments">work it out manually</a> using guidance on GOV.UK.</p>
          </section>
          <section class="revealable revealable--adviser">
            <h3>How long statutory sick pay is paid for</h3>
            <p>SSP is paid for up to 28 weeks. This can be either:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>continuous</li>
              <li>several periods of sickness added together to make up 28 weeks - across a maximum of 3 years</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Once the client has claimed for 28 weeks or reached the 3-year limit they can <a href="/Views/Pages/Beta/BetaContentPageTemplate.aspx?id=54347">apply for Employment and Support Allowance</a> (ESA).</p>
            <div class="callout--warning">
              <p>If a client has been off sick continuously or a number of times over a long period they may have a disability and you should check for any disability discrimination issues.</p>
            </div>
          </section>
          <section class="revealable revealable--adviser">
            <h3>If your client is off sick more than once</h3>
            <p>If your client is off sick more than once, it will count as a single period of incapacity for work if the absences:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>are each 4 or more days in a row</li>
              <li>take place within 8 weeks</li>
            </ul>
            <p>In this situation the client doesn’t have to wait 3 days to get paid SSP again.</p>
            <p>If the absences are more than 8 weeks apart the client will start a new period of incapacity, and have to wait the 3 days before getting SSP.</p>
            <h3>Who isn’t entitled to statutory sick pay</h3>
            <p>You won’t get SSP if you:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>are self-employed</li>
              <li>have already had SSP for 28 weeks</li>
              <li>are getting statutory maternity pay or Maternity Allowance</li>
              <li>are pregnant and your baby is due in 4 weeks or less</li>
              <li>had a baby in the last 14 weeks (or the last 18 weeks if your baby was born over 4 weeks early)</li>
              <li>are an agricultural worker (<a href="https://www.gov.uk/agricultural-sick-pay">read about agricultural sick pay on GOV.UK</a>)</li>
              <li>are in the armed forces</li>
            </ul>
          </section>
          <div class="callout--alert">
            <p>Even if your employer says you're '<a href="https://www.gov.uk/employment-status/selfemployed-contractor">self-employed</a>', you might in fact be a '<a href="https://www.gov.uk/employment-status/selfemployed-contractor">worker</a>' and entitled to sick pay. It’s always best to check if this applies to you - contact <a href="#">your nearest Citizens Advice</a> if you’re not sure.</p>

          <h2 class="ref-heading"><span class="ref-heading__heading">When you have more than one employer</span><span class="ref-heading__toggle ref-heading__toggle--off"><a class="js-toggle-ref">Add reference</a></span></h2>
          <p>If you have more than one employer you could be entitled to sick pay from each one. For each employer, the rules are the same as if they were your only employer.</p>
          <p>If your illness means you can do one of your jobs, but not the other, you could get sick pay from one while getting your normal wages from another.</p>
          <h2>If your employer refuses to pay your sick pay</h2>
          <p>If you’re not getting the pay your contract says you’re entitled to, you can <a href="#">take steps to get the money you’re owed</a>.</p>
          <p>If you’re entitled to statutory pay but your employer refuses to pay it, you should contact HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC).</p>
          <p>HMRC employees’ enquiry line<br>Telephone: 0300 200 3500<br>Textphone: 0300 200 3212<br>Open Monday to Friday, 8am to 5pm.</p>
          <p>Calls can cost up to 12p a minute from landlines, and between 3p and 45p a minute from mobiles.</p>
          <p>If you need more help at any stage, <a href="#">contact your nearest Citizens Advice</a></p>
          <h2 class="ref-heading"><span class="ref-heading__heading">What to do if you’re not entitled to sick pay</span><span class="ref-heading__toggle ref-heading__toggle--off"><a class="js-toggle-ref">Add reference</a></span></h2>
          <p>If your employer says you’re not entitled to sick pay, ask them to give you a written explanation of their reasons. They should give you this on a form called <a href="#">Statutory sick pay and an employee’s claim for benefit (SSP1)</a>. They should give you this within 7 days of you going off sick.</p>
          <p>You’ll need the SSP1 form to claim benefits. If you can’t get sick pay, you might be able to claim <a href="#">Employment and Support Allowance</a> and other benefits. <a href="#">Use our benefits checker</a> to see what you might be entitled to.</p>
          <p>If your employer doesn’t give you form SSP1 there are 2 steps to take:</p>
          <h3 class="ref-heading"><span class="ref-heading__heading">Step 1: request a written statement</span><span class="ref-heading__toggle ref-heading__toggle--off"><a class="js-toggle-ref">Add reference</a></span></h3>
          <p>If your employer hasn’t given you form SSP1, ask them for a written statement explaining why you can’t get Statutory Sick Pay. You could also give them <a href="#">a copy of the form</a> to fill in.</p>
          <h3 class="ref-heading"><span class="ref-heading__heading">Step 2: contact HMRC</span><span class="ref-heading__toggle ref-heading__toggle--off"><a class="js-toggle-ref">Add reference</a></span></h3>
          <p>If you can’t get form SSP1 or a written statement from your employer, contact HMRC’s employees' enquiry line on 0300 200 3500. They’ll ask your employer why they think you’re not entitled to SSP.</p>

            <h3>If your client works part-time</h3>
            <p>Every day your client works is a qualifying day, even if they only work for a couple of hours.</p>
            <p>If your client works a few days each week, or different days each week, they will have to agree with their employer which days count as qualifying days.</p>
            <p>This will affect how long they have to be off before they start getting sick pay, as well as how much sick pay they get for each day they miss.</p>
            <p>It can be difficult to work out the best conditions, so you might need to <a href="#">get specialist help</a>.</p>
            <div class="callout--quote">
              <h3>Example</h3>
              <h5>The employer agrees that only normal working days are qualifying days</h5>
              <p>Frida works Mondays and Tuesdays. She agrees with her employer that Mondays and Tuesdays will be her qualifying days.</p>
              <p>She falls ill on Tuesday 1 November. Her sick pay won't start till Monday 14 November.</p>
              <p>This is because her waiting days will be the Tuesday she falls ill and the next Monday and Tuesday.</p>
              <p>She'll get the full rate of SSP - half the weekly rate for each Monday or Tuesday she's sick, as her working week is 2 days.</p>
              <h5>The employer agrees that all weekdays are qualifying days</h5>
              <p>Jan works Mondays and Tuesdays. He agrees with his employer that all weekdays are qualifying days.</p>
              <p>He falls ill on Tuesday 1 November. His sick pay will start on Friday 5 November - his waiting days will be Tuesday to Thursday of that week.</p>
              <p>He'll get the full rate of SSP. He'll get one-fifth of the weekly rate for each weekday he's sick - not just the days he'd normally work.</p>
