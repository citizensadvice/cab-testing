			p Most people, after submitting the ESA50 form, will be asked to go for a medical assessment, called a ‘Work Capability Assessment’. The assessments are carried out by the Health Assessment Advisory Service.

			p The service will phone you to arrange a date and time for the assessment. If you’d rather be contacted in a different way, you can let the Health Assessment Advisory Service know by emailing them, or you can get someone else to call them for you and let them know you’d prefer to be emailed.

			p Email: customer-relations@chdauk.co.uk

				| Telephone: 0800 288 8777

			p When they contact you, the service will also tell you which of their centres you need to go to for your assessment.

			.callout
				h3 Worth remembering
				
				p If your illness or disability makes it difficult or impossible for you to travel to an assessment, you can ask for the assessment to be done at home instead. Tell the Health Assessment Advisory Service when they call – they’ll ask you to provide information from your doctor, or other medical professional, to explain why you can’t travel.
