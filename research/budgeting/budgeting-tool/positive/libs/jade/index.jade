	h2 What youâ€™ll need

	p Decide whether you're doing the budget for:
	ul
		li just you
		li for you and your partner, or 
		li for your family

	p You then need:
	ul
		li bank statements
		li payslips
		li details of any benefits
		li debit card statements or bills
		li receipts from anything you paid for in cash

	p The more accurate your figures are, the more accurate and useful the results will be to you. However, if you just want to use rough figures you can do that and get a general idea of your budget.
