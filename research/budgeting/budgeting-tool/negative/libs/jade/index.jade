	//p Your budget will help you:
	//ul
		li see where your money goes each month
		li see where you could cut your spending
		li spot problems early - for example, if you’re spending more than you’ve got coming in
		li start the process of finding the right solution to pay off debts
		li see you whether you can afford loan repayments, if you’re considering #[a(href="#") borrowing money]

	//p Doing your budget can take a bit of time - but it’ll be worth it. It can help to do your budget every month, or every few months, especially if your circumstances change.


	h2 What you’ll need

	p Decide whether you're doing the budget for:
	ul
		li just you
		li for you and your partner, or 
		li for your family

	p You then need to know the details below for everyone you want to include. 

	p First, you’ll need amounts for all the money you’ve got coming in, for example:
	ul
		li earnings from work (you’ll need your net income - the amount you get after tax and National Insurance has been taken off) - you should be able to get earning amounts from your payslips or bank statement
		li any benefits you get - you can find the amounts in a bank statement 
		li child support or maintenance you get from an ex-partner
		li money from a lodger
		li money from relatives or friends living with you
		li pensions
		li anything from investments and savings 

	p Then, you’ll need the amounts for all your money going out, for example:
	ul
		li household bills - gas, electricity, water, telephone, TV, internet, Council Tax, insurance
		li mortgage or rent payments
		li any purchases shown on your bank statements or credit card statements for the last month
		li any purchases you made with cash over the last month (you might have receipts for these or you might have to make some guesses about what you’ve bought)  

	p The more accurate your figures are, the more accurate and useful the results will be to you. However, if you just want to input rough figures, you can do that and get a rougher idea of your budget.
