The terms of the insurance cover contained in the policy document should be checked to see what cover is provided and how to claim. Usually there is a time scale within which a policy holder must make a claim.</p>
<p><span class="paranum" data-mce-mark="1">16</span>Payment protection insurance (PPI) is commonly taken out with mortgages, loans, credit/store cards or catalogue payments. It is sometimes known as accident, sickness and unemployment (ASU) insurance, ‘Account Cover’ or ‘Payment Cover’.</p>
<p><span class="paranum" data-mce-mark="1">17</span>Depending on the individual insurance contract, cover may apply where the policy holder has an accident or sickness, or becomes unemployed through no fault of her/his own. If the policy holder is covered, the insurance company will pay the monthly repayments (or a percentage of them) on behalf of the policy holder for a fixed period of time.</p>
<p><span class="paranum" data-mce-mark="1">18</span>Many clients have taken out PPI but find they are not covered because the insurance was mis-sold, for example, because the client was already unemployed or sick. The client may need to cancel the policy and may wish to claim a refund of premiums in the event of mis-selling.</p>

<p><span class="paranum" data-mce-mark="1">34</span>In Scotland, there is a time limit of five years or 20 years for taking legal action to claim money owed. The time limit depends on the type of debt owed. Some of the rules are complicated, for example, if there are arrears of payments of mortgage interest the lender has five years to take action, but where there are arrears of payments on the principal sum (capital) owed under a mortgage, the time limit is 20 years. The rules for time limits for pursuing some debts relating to payments administered by a UK government agency cut across the five or 20 year rules in Scotland. The main examples are:-</p>
